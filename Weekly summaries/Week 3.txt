Did miscelaneous optimizations. In particular, QR for canonization, efficient local operator evaluations.
Also rewrote the expand MPS/MPO functions for faster testing.

Tried RSVD but could not quite get it to make sensible results / get a speedup.

Will now try to reproduce Giacommo results for U_b = 0 and U_c = 0,5 and 1,1 .

From Giacommo paper, length of simulation should be t = (0.5*N)/J.

I can not seem to reproduce insulating phase with U_c = 1,1 for N = 10. Perhaps finite size. Trying U_c = 1,5 . Seems to work for U_c = 1,5
