End of week 1 :

Still unsure whether to study spin transport in spin 1 XXZ (which is known to have Luttinger liquid phase in ground state, so we sould expect interesting transport),
study second neighbor coupling spin 1/2 chain which could have similar properties, or abandon spin chains and study quadratically driven bulk-dissipative 
Bose-Hubbard chains.

Read miscelaneous articles tangentially related to the field.
