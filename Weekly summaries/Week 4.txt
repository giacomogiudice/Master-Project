This week, I try to reproduce conducting/insulating phase transition results from Giacommo's paper.

Jobs to launch :
U_c = 0.5 ; 1.1
N = 20,30,40,50,60,70.

Simulation time is N/2J , timestep 0.05/J .
Memory should be barely enough for the bigger jobs, might need to apply and cut immediately for higher chain lengths
