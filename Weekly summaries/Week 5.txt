Last Friday I launched three computations for N=40 Uc=0 Ub=1,1. 

One with D=400 and the possibility for more iterative compression sweeps, giving 6 free sweeps. Not once has it changed anything. Perhaps I should allow
20 or 30 just to be sure that it never results in improvement.

The two others were with D=600. One with a ground-state and another with and X-state starting state. Unfortunately
both ran out of memory. I wrote a small script to estimate memory needs.

I wrote a memory-cheap implementation of apply-compress that recomputes MPO_MPS tensor elements on the fly when
they are needed, thus never storing the Large MPS.

Relaunching with new implementation.
