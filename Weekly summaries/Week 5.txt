Last Friday I launched three computations for N=40 Uc=0 Ub=1,1. 

One with D=400 and the possibility for more iterative compression sweeps, giving 6 free sweeps. Not once has it changed anything. Perhaps I should allow
20 or 30 just to be sure that it never results in improvement.

The two others were with D=600. One with a ground-state and another with and X-state starting state. Unfortunately
both ran out of memory. I wrote a small script to estimate memory needs.

I wrote a memory-cheap implementation of apply-compress that recomputes MPO_MPS tensor elements on the fly when
they are needed, thus never storing the Large MPS.

Group meeting : decided to focus on the Uc = Ub line for now, and a line close to the Ub = 0 line to see if the diffusive Heisenberg point
opens up into more than a single point of diffusive behavior.

The initial results for 0.5 and 1.1 show system size independent behavior, but a qualitative change between current going to a constant positive
value or what seems to be 0 for 1.1. To be sure that the current converges to 0 longer chains and longer time dynamics seem necessary.
I have launched a bunch of them with bond dimensions 100, and Nb = 1.5*Nc .

Another thing to investigate was the phase dependence of the Z transport on phases of the XY state.
